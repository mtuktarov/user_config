### Installing your Vim environment on another machine
Once your vim configuration is under version control, itâ€™s quite straightforward to import your settings to any machine that has git installed. If you followed the instructions above to put your vimrc and plugins in a *dotvim* directory, then you can follow these steps to synchronise them to another machine:
```
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/mtuktarov/vim.git
ln -s ~/.vim/vimrc ~/.vimrc
ln -s ~/.vim/gvimrc ~/.gvimrc
cd ~/.vim
git submodule update --init
```

### Upgrading a plugin bundle

At some point in the future, the fugitive plugin might be updated. To fetch the latest changes, go into the fugitive repository, and pull the latest version:

```
cd ~/.vim/bundle/fugitive
git pull origin master
```

### Upgrading all bundled plugins

You can use the *foreach* command to execute any shell script in from the root of all submodule directories. To update to the latest version of each plugin bundle, run the following:

```
git submodule foreach git pull origin master
```
